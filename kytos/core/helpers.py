def listen_to(event, *events):
    """Decorator for Event Listener methods.

    This decorator was built to be used on NAPPs methods to define which
    type of event the method will handle. With this, we will be able to
    'schedule' the app/method to receive an event when a new event is
    registered on the controller buffers.
    By using the run_on_thread decorator, we also guarantee that the method
    (handler) will be called from inside a new thread, avoiding this method to
    block its caller.

    The decorator will add an attribute to the method called 'events', that
    will be a list of the events that the method will handle.

    The event that will be listened to is always a string, but it can represent
    a regular expression to match against multiple Event Types. All listened
    events is documented in :doc:`developer/listened_events` section.

    Example of usage:

    .. code-block:: python3

        class MyAppClass(KytosApp):
            @listen_to('kytos/of_core.messages.in')
            def my_handler_of_message_in(self, event):
                # Do stuff here...

            @listen_to('kytos/of_core.messages.out')
            def my_handler_of_message_out(self, event):
                # Do stuff here...

            @listen_to('kytos/of_core.messages.in.ofpt_hello',
                       'kytos/of_core.messages.out.ofpt_hello')
            def my_handler_of_hello_messages(self, event):
                # Do stuff here...

            @listen_to('kytos/of_core.message.*.hello')
            def my_other_handler_of_hello_messages(self, event):
                # Do stuff here...

            def my_handler_of_hello_messages(self, event):
