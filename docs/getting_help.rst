Getting help
============

You can find us on the **#kytos** IRC channel on **freenode.net** network.

We also have two mailing lists:

- **Community List** `<community (at) lists (dot) kytos (dot) io>
  <https://lists.kytos.io/listinfo/community>`__ - where you can get help, from
  us and also from *Kytos* community, and also exchange experiences with other
  users.
- **Devel List** `<devel (at) lists (dot) kytos (dot) io>
  <https://lists.kytos.io/listinfo/devel>`__ - *Kytos* developers mailing list,
  in which the development of the project is discussed.
