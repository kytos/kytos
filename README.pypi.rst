**WARNING: As previously announced on our communication channels, the Kytos
project will enter the "shutdown" phase on May 31, 2021. After this date,
only critical patches (security and core bug fixes) will be accepted, and the
project will be in "critical-only" mode for another six months (until November
30, 2021). For more information visit the FAQ at <https://kytos.io/faq>. We'll
have eternal gratitude to the entire community of developers and users that made
the project so far.**

`Kytos SDN Platform <https://kytos.io>`_ is the fastest way to deploy an SDN
Network. With this you can deploy a basic OpenFlow controller or your own
controller. Kytos was designed to be easy to install, use, develop and share
Network Apps (NApps). Kytos is incredibly powerful and easy, its modular design
makes Kytos a lightweight SDN Platform.

Kytos is conceived to ease SDN controllers development and deployment. It was
motivated by some gaps left by common SDN solutions. Moreover, it has strong
tights with a community view, so it is centered on the development of
applications by its users. Thus, our intention is not only to build a new SDN
solution, but also to build a community of developers around it, creating new
applications that benefit from the SDN paradigm.

The project was born in 2014 and has been under active development since
2016.
