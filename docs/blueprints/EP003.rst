Abstract
########

Here we have the main Tests guidelines of the ``python-openflow`` library.

The main guidelines are:

* Follow TDD, which means: Write tests before writing code!!
* We aim test coverage of 100%;
* Invalid messages must raise exceptions, and these exceptions must be covered by unittests;
* All Messages must be tested (for attributes order and also size);
* All reimplemented methods must be tested.

Basic Tests
###########

Considering the above described guidelines, below are some tasks that need to be done:

* **Struct size**: assert the basic class size according to OFSpec (structs asserts) (``get_size`` method);
* **Pack**:

  * Check by comparing the result of pack() with raw files;
  * This must be done for all messages, 'structs' and basic_types;

* **Unpack**:

  * Check by unpacking a known raw file and evaluating the values of the unpacked object with the expected ones;
  * This must be done for all messages, 'structs' and basic_types;

* OpenFlow Spec compliance for **attributes restrictions**:

  * Look for constrains defined on the OpenFlow specification for each attribute (Not all attributes have constrains);
  * Main constrains: value limitation based on pre-defined constants
