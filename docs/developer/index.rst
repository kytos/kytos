KYTOS SDN PLATFORM WAS DESIGNED TO BE EASY TO USE, DEVELOP AND SHARE NETWORK APPS


This section was designed to lead new developers in understanding the Kytos
project. First, we recommend the reading of the Kytos architecture in
:doc:`Devel Guide </developer/intro>`. There you will learn how to install
and configure Kytos and the NApps, as well as understand the develop
environment. Then, give a try to the `tutorials <http://tutorials.kytos.io/>`__
made by Kytos Team.

Kytos Summit is the main Kytos Project’s event. In addition to afull schedule of technical and social talks, Kytos Summit provides an opportunity for developers, contributors and other interested people to meet in person and work together more closely.

Here, we will discuss the future of the project as well as which features we will focus our efforts on during the next release cycle.
