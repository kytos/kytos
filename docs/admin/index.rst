KYTOS SDN PLATFORM WAS DESIGNED TO BE EASY TO USE, DEVELOP AND SHARE NETWORK APPS

In this guide, you will learn Kytos Platform basics such as an overview of the
major components and a quick start for installing, downloading and running a
Network Application (NApp).

For more details, advanced users can later proceed to the :doc:`Admin Guide </admin/architecture>`.

Here, we will discuss the future of the project as well as which features we will focus our efforts on during the next release cycle. Kytos Summit is the main Kytos Project's event. In addition to a full schedule of technical and social talks, Kytos Summit provides an opportunity for developers, contributors and other interested people to meet in person and work together more closely.
