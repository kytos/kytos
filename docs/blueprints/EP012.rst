Description
===========
The Metro Ethernet Forum (MEF) has created the MEF Carrier Ethernet (CE)
certification aiming to standardize the language used in interactions between
ISPs and users. Each MEF CE service is composed by many basic items, such as
User Network Interfaces (UNI), service restoration time and bandwidth profiles.

A MEF E-Line service or Ethernet Virtual Service (EVC) is a service type to
connect exactly two UNIs where those two UNIs can communicate only with one
another. The MEF E-Line service is defined by MEF 6.2 and MEF 10.3
specifications.

The MEF E-Line services has two categories:

  * EPL or Ethernet Private Line (Port-based)
  * EVPL or Ethernet Virtual Private Line (VLAN-based)

The main distinction between EPL and EVPL is that EPL encapsulates all traffic
between two UNIs while EVPL uses a virtual circuit distinguisher, such as a
VLAN VID or a MPLS TAG, to create the virtual service.

This blueprint describes the requirements to support MEF E-Line services over
the Kytos SDN Platform as a NApp or a set of NApps.

REST API and WEB UI
===================
Service provisioning and monitoring will be supported initially via REST API.
The support for a web UI is planned for future releases.

Provisioning Requirements
=========================

In this section we describe the target behaviour. All code here is in
pseudo-code.

1. User submits an EVC request via E-Line NApp's REST

#. For EVPL: E-Line NApp verifies if UNI_A's requested C-VID and UNI_Z's requested C-VID are
   available from the interfaces' pools.

#. E-Line NApp requests a primary and a backup path to the Pathfinder NApp
   using the attributes _primary_links_ and _backup_links_ submitted via REST

#. For each link composing paths in #3:

   #. E-Line NApp requests a S-VID available from the link VLAN pool.
   #. Using the S-VID obtained, generate abstract flow entries to be sent to
      FlowManager

#. Push abstract flow entries to FlowManager and FlowManager pushes OpenFlow
   entries to datapaths

#. E-Line NApp generates an event to notify all Kytos NApps of a new EVC
   creation

#. Notify user of the status of its request

.. note::

  EVCs must be created even if there is a link or interface down in the path.
  In this case, user should be notified that the EVC was created but it
  is not operational.

In order to create an EVC, the user must send a POST request using the
following example:

.. code:: bash

  POST /kytos/mef_eline/v2.0/evc/

Information necessary to create the EVC:

.. code:: bash

  {UNI_A*, UNI_Z*, str name*, str bandwidth, datetime start_date, datetime
  end_date, [str primary_links], [str backup_links], bool dynamic_backup_path,
  tenant, service_level}

**\*Required fields**

.. code:: python

  class TAG:
     tag_type
     value

  class Interface:
     dpid
     port

  class UNI(Interface):
    user_tag # TAG object

  class NNI(Interface)

  class vNNI(NNI)
    service_tag # TAG object

  class EVC:
    _requested  # dict with the user original request (input)
    id = uuid()
    current_path  # circuit being used at the moment
    primary_path  # primary circuit offered to user IF one or more links were provided in the request
    backup_path  # backup circuit offered to the user IF one or more links were provided in the request
    request_time = now()  # datetime of user request for a EVC
    creation_time = now() | schedule()  # datetime when the circuit should be activated
    owner = get_user(REST)
    status = [UP|DOWN]  # (operation)
    enabled = [True|False]  # (administrative)
    priority = Integer  # service level provided in the request. "gold", "silver", ...
    # (...) everything else from request must be @property

    def create()
    def discover_new_path()
    def change_path(path)
    def reprovision()  # force EVC (re-)provisioning
    def remove()


**Default values:**

.. code:: python

  start_date = now()
  end_date = # never
  primary_links = # system provided
  backup_links = # system provided
  bandwidth = None

**Return Codes Examples:**

        200: Circuit created
        201: Circuit created but not active (link down)
        401: Permission denied

Interface tags pool mechanism
-----------------------------

*For each Interface object:*
Each Interface object will have its own VLAN pool with pop() and push()
methods. This pool will be used for EPLs. Administrator might predefine via
configuration the VLAN pool to be used (for instance, VLAN 100 to 200).

*For each Link object:*
Each Link object will have its own VLAN pool to be used by two
directly-connected NNIs. pop() and push() methods should be available.
Administrator might predefine via configuration the VLAN pool to be used
(for instance, VLAN 100 to 200).

    REST request but only UNI_A and UNI_Z will be processed.

Milestone: Basic EPL and EVPL with explicit primary_links and backup_links
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Dependencies:* 1. Pathfinder must support search with specific paths; 2.
Topology must support static topology (topology with links and interfaces that
are down)

*Target Release:* 2018.1b1

*Features:*

  * REST requests' explicit-provided _primary_links_ and _backup_links_ will
    be used.

*Additional Information:*

  * None

Milestone:  Calendaring
-----------------------

*Dependencies:* 1. Calendaring Napp (thread looking for circuits to be
activated)

*Target Release:* TBA

*Features:*

  * EVC will support scheduling for activation and removal, processing both
    REST options start_date and end_date
  * EVC will support of scheduling of specific routines and time intervals,
    such as _every_night_, _every_tuesday_, _every_day_from_2am_to_5pm_, and
    others.

*Additional Information:*

  * None

Milestone: Link Protection
--------------------------

*Dependencies:*

*Target Release:* TBA

*Features:*

  * EVCs will have support for backup paths
  * EVCs will have support for explicit-provided paths
  * Users might have redundant UNIs in different networking devices working in
    an active/backup approach;

Milestone: Metrics Requirements
-------------------------------

*Dependencies:*

*Target Release:* TBA

*Features:*

  * For path definition, user might require specific link metrics (any path,
    limited by # of hops, using specific metrics (cost, average utilization,
    available bandwidth, one-way delay, loss seen, custom/affinity, etc.).
  * Users might request specific bandwidth profiles (bandwidth profiles have
    higher priority over metrics specified during the path definition and
    bandwidth profiles might have a queue associated with the circuit)
