Description
###########

This `blueprint` defines how the ``xid`` of OpenFlowMessages should be treated.

Solution
########

The default behavior related to ``xid`` of OpenFlowMessages when replying a
received message is to use the same ``xid`` of the received message.

On the case of sending a new message that is not a specific reply to a
received message, then we will use a random ``xid`` (considering that the
``xid`` field is a ``UBInt32``).

The ``python-openflow`` (pyof) library already implements this random
fulfillment of the ``xid`` attribute, so when creating new messages we just
need to not pass any data to this parameter.

Recap
-----
Response Messages -> same ``xid`` of the received message

New messages -> default ``python-openflow`` behaviour (random ``xid``)
