Description
===========
This blueprint specifies changes in `flow_manager` to better track the
FLOW MOD messages sent to the switches.


OFPT_ERROR
----------
Errors in the FLOW MOD sent back by the switch are not treated by the
`flow_manager` NApp. The NApp must listen
to incoming errors in order to identify errors related to FLOW MODs it sent.
To do that, when a FLOW MOD is sent, its XID (transaction id) must be recorded
to be compared to the XID of the error message. If such an error happens, the
NApp should generate an event with the FLOW MOD that caused the error, so the
calling application knows an error occurred and then it can handle the error
accordingly.


Request errors
--------------
Proper error codes are returned when the JSON sent in the request is malformed,
or if the switch does not exist or is disabled.
But if an non-existent flow attribute is sent, the request is accepted
(although this really causes no problem, as the non-existent attributes are
simple ignored) or if invalid values are sent, errors are not handled.
When an application tries to send a message with a wrong type value (a string
instead of an integer, for example), the controller crashes. In that
scenario, the caller is receiving a `200 Ok` reply.
The application should check if the received parameters have the correct
values to avoid errors in the controller and to let the caller know it sent
an incorrect request.

Delete method
-------------
The endpoint to remove a flow is a `POST` to `/v2/delete`. It must be changed
to a `DELETE` to `/v2/flows`, and the `POST` must be marked as deprecated.
